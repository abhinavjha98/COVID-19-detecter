### Introduction
Coronavirus disease (COVID-19) is an infectious disease caused by a new virus.
The disease causes respiratory illness (like the flu) with symptoms such as a cough, fever, and in more severe cases, difficulty breathing. You can protect yourself by washing your hands frequently, avoiding touching your face, and avoiding close contact (1 meter or 3 feet) with people who are unwell.

## Idea

The idea is to stop the transmission by prioritizing tests and hence detecting the cases quickly.

---
## Model

- A machine learning model is trained on the data to findout the probability of person having the infection.
- The model is then used to find out whom to test for infection first under a limited testing capacity.

---
## Machine learning parameters

- Sample set of parameters are as follow:
- Features:
	* Fever - Continuous
	* Body Pain - Binary(0/1)
	* Age - Discrete
	* Runny Nose - Binary(0/1)
	* Difficulty breathing - Categorical(-1/0/1)
- Labels:
	* Probability of COVID-19 infection
